##### Another example of the parentheses matching problem comes from hypertext markup language (HTML). In HTML, tags exist in both opening and closing forms and must be balanced to properly describe a web document. This very simple HTML document:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

##### is intended only to show the matching and nesting structure for tags in the language. Write a program that can check an HTML document for proper opening and closing tags.
